App-Smolder-Report

The App::Smolder::Report distribution provides a command line tool,
smolder_report, that allows you to submit smoke reports to a Smolder
server.

First you need to generate your smoke report. The easiest way to do it is:

    prove -l -a smoke.tgz

Then you need to submit your smoke.tgz report to Smolder:

    smolder_report --server=hostname --project-id=1 --username=me \
                   --password=secret smoke.tgz

That's it!

You can also have a .smolder.conf with all the important parameters.
